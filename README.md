[![godoc v1](https://img.shields.io/badge/godoc-v1-375EAB.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/Attendly/maillist)

A Go based mailing list manager.

This package allows lists of email addresses to be managed, and
schedules e-mail campaigns to be sent to them.

It is currently tied to the Sendgrid API, and probably only used
internally at Attendly.

Please see the API docs for usage information.
